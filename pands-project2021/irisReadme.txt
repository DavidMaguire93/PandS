           	- Wrote code for simple row / column viewing for preliminary study, code researched from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-basics-of-pandas-using-iris-dataset/


Notes / Plans

I am just leaving this here is a 'project plan' and outline my thoughts and goals that I can come back to. I may leave this section or delete it before the final submission.

Premilinary analysis of the data data set will be standard analysis: mean, median, min, max, range, 25% and 75% quotient based on the different measurements of the different species.
Further analysis will involve getting corellations of the variables, possibly through different means of correlation.
I would also like to get ratio variables (sepal length: petal width etc.) and correlate those by species.

Visually, I would like to use a variety of bar charts, histograms, pie charts and some 3d charts that will have to be researched. While some may not end up being used, it would still be good to learn how to use them.
I imagine that I will end up using a compination of matplotlib and seaborn to get the desired charts and diagrams.
